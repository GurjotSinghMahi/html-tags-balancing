<b><font size=15>HTML TAGS BALANCING USING STACK</font></b>

A simple exercise for testing a stack is determining whether a set of html tags in html file are well-formed/Balanced or not.
What exactly is meant by that? In the case of a pair of html tags to be well formed, consider the following table.

&#60;html&#62;&#60;title&#62;&#60;/title&#62;&#60;/html&#62; <- Well formed and balanced

<html><title><title></html> <- Not Balanced
